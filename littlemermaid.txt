(If only) I (could) make him understand.ã€€<br>
<br>
I just don't see things the way he does. <br>
<br>
I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things -- could be bad.<br>
<br>
Look at this stuff. Isn't it neat?<br>
<br>
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?<br>
<br>
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl<br>
<br>
The girl who has everything?<br>
<br>
Look at this (trove), <br>
<br>
Treasures Untold.<br>
<br>
How many wonders can one cover 'nd hold?<br>
<br>
Lookin' around here you('d) think.<br>
<br>
Sure, she's got everything.<br>
<br>
I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty.<br>
<br>
I've got (whozits and whatzits) (galore).<br>
<br>
You want (thingamabobs?)<br>
<br>
I've got twenty.<br>
<br>
But who cares, no big deal. I want more.<br>
<br>
I wannna be where the people are.<br>
<br>
I wanna see, wanna see ('em) dancin'<br>
<br>
Walkin' around on those, "whad'ya call 'em? oh, feet."<br>
<br>
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far.<br>
<br>
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'.<br>
<br>
Strollin' along down (a), "what's (that) word again?" street<br>
<br>
Up where they walk, up where they run, up where they stay (all day) in the sun. <br>
<br>
Wanderin' free. Wish I could be part of that world. <br>
<br>
Oh, what a swim.<br>
<br>
Scuttle, look what we found.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we (were in this sunken ship) - it was really creepy.<br>
<br>
Human stuff, huh? Hey, lemme see. <br>
<br>
Look at this. Wow, this is special. This is very very unusual.<br>
<br>
What? What is it?<br>
<br>
It's a (dinglehopper!). Humans use (these) little babies to straighten their hair (out).<br>
<br>
See, (just a little twirl here) an' a yank there and (voiolay!) You got an (aesthetically) pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over!<br>
<br>
A dinglehopper!<br>
<br>
What about that one?<br>
<br>
Ah, this I haven't seen in years. This is wonderful. A (banded, bulbous snarfblat). Now, the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times, when humans used to sit around, and stare at each other all day. Got very boring. So, they invented this snarfblat to make fine music. Allow me. <br>
<br>
Music? Oh, the concert! Oh my gosh. My father's gonna kill me!<br>
<br>
The concert was today?<br>
<br>
Uh, I'm sorry. I gotta go. Thank you Scuttle!<br>
<br>
